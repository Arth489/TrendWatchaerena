Furthermore, the expanding patient base and improvements in healthcare infrastructure across emerging markets are expected to contribute to the market's growth. As the global understanding of rare bone diseases like XLH advances, demand for effective therapies like Burosumab is likely to rise substantially over the forecast period.</p><p>In addition, the market is benefiting from significant advancements in biotechnology and the growing availability of specialized treatment options. As Burosumab is a targeted therapy, its ability to address the underlying causes of XLH rather than just managing symptoms is helping to boost its adoption among patients and healthcare providers. This trend is expected to continue, with more regulatory approvals for expanded indications and improved accessibility leading to further market expansion.
